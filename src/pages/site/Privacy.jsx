          <h2>What we collect</h2>
          <p>We collect only the information you give us directly: name, email, shipping address, and payment information at checkout. We do not buy or sell mailing lists.</p>

          <h2>How we use it</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>To fulfil orders you place and contact you about them.</li>
            <li>To send you our newsletter, only if you have opted in. You can unsubscribe at any time from any newsletter footer.</li>

          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>We use a small number of cookies for session, cart, and analytics. You can disable them in your browser without breaking the site, except cart functions during checkout.</p>

          <h2>Third-party services</h2>
          <p>Our checkout, fulfilment, and analytics rely on third-party providers who only receive the information they need to do their job. They are bound by their own privacy policies.</p>

          <h2>Your rights</h2>
          <p>Under the GDPR (Iceland is in the EEA) you have the right to access, correct, delete, or export your personal data, and to withdraw consent for processing. Write to <a href={`mailto:${BRAND_INFO.contact.email}`}>{BRAND_INFO.contact.email}</a> and we will respond within 30 days.</p>
