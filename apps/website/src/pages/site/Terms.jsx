          <p>This is a placeholder template. Replace with the studio's actual terms before going live. By using anothercreation.com you agree to these terms. The site is operated by {BRAND_INFO.legal.entity}, kennitala {BRAND_INFO.legal.kt}.</p>

          <h2>Orders</h2>
          <p>Placing an order is an offer to buy. We confirm orders by email. Stock availability and pricing are not guaranteed until your order is confirmed.</p>

          <h2>Made-to-order</h2>
          <p>Made-to-order pieces (atelier work) are produced specifically for you after a confirmation deposit. Lead time is approximately four weeks. Final sizing is set at the first fitting; we cannot accept returns of made-to-order pieces unless faulty.</p>

          <h2>Print-on-demand</h2>
          <p>Print-on-demand pieces are produced after order. Production takes 2–7 business days; shipping follows. We pass through the carrier's tracking once dispatched.</p>

          <h2>Pricing & currency</h2>
          <p>Prices on the site are in EUR including any applicable VAT. International orders may incur duties or taxes at the destination, which are the customer's responsibility.</p>
